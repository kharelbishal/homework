Introduction
This report reflects on my experiences volunteering with two impactful organizations: the Rev. Bill Crews Foundation and Palms Australia. Both placements allowed me to engage deeply with marginalized communities, providing essential services and support while developing my own skills and understanding of community engagement.

Rev. Bill Crews Foundation is a charity dedicated to assisting individuals affected by homelessness, poverty, and unemployment. Founded by Rev. Bill Crews, the organization offers critical services, including food, healthcare, and welfare support. Through initiatives like the Loaves & Fishes Free Restaurant, the Foundation has served over 9 million meals, significantly impacting the lives of those in need. During my time there, I prepared and served food, distributed essential items such as towels and toilet kits, sorted clothing donations, and engaged with guests through games, fostering connections that highlighted the importance of empathy and respect.

In contrast, Palms Australia focuses on international development by fostering solidarity and building sustainable communities. This non-profit organization believes in the interconnectedness of all life and promotes justice and peace through partnerships with local communities to combat poverty and inequality. My role involved redesigning the Palms Australia website to improve visibility and communication for overseas missions. This project included optimizing user experience and integrating SEO features, collaborating with stakeholders, and training staff on new IT infrastructure. The successful launch of the revamped site led to a notable increase in inquiries and applications for mission opportunities.

Together, these experiences have profoundly shaped my understanding of community engagement and my role within it, offering insights into both local and global contexts of service and support.
