Critical Reflection on Development
Professional Development
Throughout my placements at the Rev. Bill Crews Foundation and Palms Australia, I developed several essential soft skills that are crucial for my future career.
1.	Communication: Effective communication was paramount, especially at the Rev. Bill Crews Foundation. Engaging with individuals experiencing homelessness required not only clear verbal communication but also active listening. During meal service, I learned to interact empathetically with guests, fostering a connection that helped me understand their needs better. This experience enhanced my ability to communicate with diverse populations, a skill that will be invaluable in any professional setting.
2.	Teamwork: Both placements emphasized the importance of collaboration. At Palms Australia, I worked on a team to redesign the organization's website. This involved brainstorming sessions where each team member’s ideas were valued. I learned to appreciate different perspectives and find common ground, enhancing our collective creativity. This teamwork experience taught me how to work effectively within a group, which is essential for any future project I may undertake.
3.	Problem Solving: My role at Palms Australia required me to address technical challenges during the website redesign. I encountered issues related to user experience that required analytical thinking and innovative solutions. By gathering feedback from stakeholders and iterating on the design, I learned how to approach problems systematically. This skill will serve me well in future roles, enabling me to tackle challenges proactively.
Personal Development
My placement experiences profoundly transformed my personal values and attitudes. Initially, I held assumptions about homelessness and poverty that were shaped by societal stereotypes. However, my time at the Rev. Bill Crews Foundation challenged these preconceptions.
Engaging with guests during meal services and participating in activities, such as playing chess, allowed me to see the individuals behind the labels. This shift in perspective was catalyzed by meaningful conversations that revealed their stories and struggles. I began to view my role not just as a service provider but as a partner in community building. This transformation has instilled in me a deeper sense of empathy and social responsibility, which I believe will guide my future interactions both personally and professionally.
Academic Development
Academically, my placements allowed me to validate key concepts related to community engagement and business theory.
One community engagement (CE) theory I observed in practice was the Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD) model. This approach focuses on identifying and leveraging the existing strengths and resources within a community rather than solely addressing deficits. At the Rev. Bill Crews Foundation, I witnessed how engaging volunteers and community members as assets enhanced program effectiveness. By fostering a sense of ownership and collaboration, the organization empowered individuals to contribute actively to their community.
In terms of business theory, I validated Katz and Kahn’s Organizational Theory, which emphasizes the importance of social systems within organizations. This theory highlights how organizational culture and interpersonal relationships influence overall performance. My experiences at both organizations illustrated this concept, as a supportive culture led to improved morale and productivity among volunteers and staff.
These academic insights not only reinforce my theoretical knowledge but also provide practical frameworks that I can apply in future roles, enhancing my understanding of effective organizational practices.
